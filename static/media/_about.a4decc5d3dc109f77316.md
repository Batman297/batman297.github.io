Hello! I'm a fresh graduate student majoring in Informatics Engineering at Universitas Buana Perjuangan Karawang. Also, I’m an activist, co-founder, and web developer at Yuk Pulih. Yuk Pulih is a community and non-profit organization. As a web developer, I’m responsible for building the official web of Yuk Pulih, starting by designing the UX flow using Figma and implementing the design using the Next.js framework.

When I was a student. I was passionate to learn new things not only learning from the lecturers. I also learned from online courses like Udemy, and Edx, and by reading some books/articles. I took 3 courses at Udemy: Web development, React, and React native courses. Also, I took Introduction to Linux at Edx. For the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, I read an online book at JavaScript.info. I believe learning the fundamentals would make me more adaptive to new technologies and new frameworks. Not only learn one programming language, but I also learn functional programming such as Haskell and Clojure by reading online books: Learn You a Haskell and Clojure for the Brave and True.

There are two more things I’ve learned. I learn the UX design when I intern at PT Fratama Kencana Gemilang. Also, I learned PHP when I work at Perum Peruri, and I participated in the Peruri Innovation Awards and won a Gold Medal for my application.
