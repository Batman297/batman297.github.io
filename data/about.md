Software Engineer at Wide Technologies Indonesia â€” an obsessed guy who loves solving problems with science and technologies.

I'm an obsessed guy who loves solving problems and making meaningful impacts on others' lives through the products that I build. For me, creating product is about identifying problems to create effective solutions to solve the problems.

Also, I'm one of the initiators who founded a community and non-profit organization (Yuk Pulih) that aimed to raise awareness of porn's negative effects and help addicts free themselves from porn addiction.
